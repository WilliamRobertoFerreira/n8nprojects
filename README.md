## 📂 Projects Showcase

Here are some of the key projects included in this repository. Each folder contains the n8n workflow `.json` file and any other relevant assets.

### 🤖 1. Automated Email Processing Agent
* **Description:** An AI agent that monitors an inbox, performs sentiment analysis on incoming emails, summarizes the content, and automatically drafts a context-aware response.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** `n8n`, `OpenAI API`, `Gmail Node`, `Natural Language Processing`.
* **Key Feature:** Demonstrates autonomous task handling in a critical business function.

### 🧠 2. Self-Updating RAG Knowledge Base
* **Description:** A system that monitors a Google Drive folder. Whenever a new document is added, it automatically processes the content, creates embeddings, and updates the vector database, keeping the knowledge base current.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** `RAG`, `Google Drive API`, `Vector Databases`, `File Automation`.
* **Key Feature:** Creates a "living" RAG system that learns continuously without manual intervention.

### 💬 3. Informational Chatbot for WhatsApp/Telegram
* **Description:** An interactive chatbot integrated directly into a messaging platform to act as an automated FAQ, provide order status updates, or serve as a product guide using a RAG-powered knowledge base.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** `Messaging API Integration`, `Webhooks`, `n8n`, `RAG`.
* **Key Feature:** Deploys AI automation on high-engagement customer channels.

### 🗓️ 4. Personal Assistant Agent (Calendar Manager)
* **Description:** An AI agent connected to Google Calendar that understands natural language commands to schedule meetings, check availability, and answer questions about upcoming events.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** `Function Calling`, `Google Calendar API`, `n8n`, `NLP`.
* **Key Feature:** Shows the AI's ability to interact with everyday tools and act as a true assistant.

### 🌐 5. Web Content Research & Extraction Tool
* **Description:** A workflow that takes a URL, uses **Firecrawl** to extract the main article content into clean Markdown, and saves it to a database like Notion or Airtable for future research.
* **Skills Demonstrated:** `Web Scraping`, `Firecrawl`, `APIs (Notion/Airtable)`, `Data Processing`.
* **Key Feature:** Automates the highly valuable task of information gathering and market research.

## 🚀 How to Use

All workflows are provided as `.json` files and can be imported directly into your n8n instance.

1.  Set up your own instance of n8n (Cloud or self-hosted).
2.  In the n8n canvas, select **Import > From File**.
3.  Upload the `.json` file for the project you wish to explore.
4.  **Important:** You will need to configure your own credentials (e.g., API keys for OpenAI, Google, etc.) in the respective nodes to run the workflows.
